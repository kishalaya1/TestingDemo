# TestingDemo
This Project is just a demonstration project for showing how to write unit test for various types of scenarios and methods in C#.
It actually shows how you do unit tests for various types of individual functions.In majority of the blog posts on unit testing that I have read on the web,most of them show to do unit testing of projects on macro level. They don't show you how to write good individual unit testing function. I am trying to address this gap. This project is a demonstrative example of how to write good unit test cases.
I hope this project will help c# developers to write unit test cases.
Technical details :
This is a C# project on .net framework 4.5.2. I have written the unit test cases using microsoft Unit testing and NUnit.I have used Moq as a mocking framework. I have written a detailed blog on unit testing.
